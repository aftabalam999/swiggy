# Swiggy (Restaurant UI)

A static, responsive restaurant landing page inspired by the Swiggy app/website. This is a front-end-only prototype built with plain HTML and CSS and a set of image assets in the `assets/` folder. It's intended as a learning/demo project and a starting point for building a production-ready food delivery UI.

## Overview

This project recreates a restaurant/food-delivery landing page with a clean navigation bar, a horizontally scrollable hero section, a "top restaurants" area, filter buttons, restaurant cards and a footer. It focuses on layout, responsive CSS and using image assets to create a visually pleasing UI.

Key ideas and goals:
- Keep the implementation simple and dependency-free (no build tools, no JS required for core layout).
- Demonstrate responsive design patterns (flexbox, horizontal scroll for hero cards, media queries).
- Use modern fonts and icons for a polished look.

## Features

- Responsive layout (desktop → mobile via CSS media queries).
- Horizontal scrollable hero section for featured categories/dishes.
- Cards for restaurants and top-places with hover states.
- Filter/navigation bar for choosing cuisine/filters (UI only).
- Footer with logo and links (static content).

## Project structure

- `index.html` — Main HTML page (landing page markup).
- `style.css`  — All styles, variables, and responsive rules.
- `assets/`    — Images and icons used across the page (logo, hero images, restaurant thumbnails, etc.).

## How to preview

1. Open the project folder in your code editor (e.g. VS Code).
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. On Windows you can run:

```powershell
Start-Process index.html
```

Or install the VS Code Live Server extension and click "Go Live" to preview with auto-reload.

## How to customize

- Colors: edit CSS variables near the top of `style.css` (the `:root` selector) to change the primary color and accents.
- Fonts: `index.html` includes Google Fonts — swap the font family link or change the `font-family` in `style.css`.
- Images: replace files in `assets/` (keep the path structure) to change brand/logo/photos.
- Add interactions: add a small JavaScript file to implement features like automatic hero carousel scroll, filter behavior, or modals for restaurant details.

## Accessibility & good practices

- Use semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, footer) when editing the markup.
- Ensure all images have meaningful `alt` attributes if you add or replace assets.
- Keep color contrast in mind when changing the theme color — test with contrast tools if needed.

## Known limitations & suggested improvements

- Currently the project is static and UI-only — no backend or real data.
- Add keyboard support and ARIA roles for improved accessibility.
- Optimize images (compress/serve responsive sizes) for faster loading.
- Add unit/integration tests if you convert this to a componentized app (React/Vue/etc.).
- Deploy easily to GitHub Pages or any static host for sharing.

## Deployment (quick)

To publish on GitHub Pages, push this folder to a repository and enable Pages from the repository settings (branch: `main` or `gh-pages`, folder: `/ (root)`). The `index.html` at the repo root will be served automatically.
